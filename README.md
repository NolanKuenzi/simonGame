===Build a Simon Game===

Contributors: NolanKuenzi

==Description==

Users are first presented with a series of random button presses. If they are then able to repeat those same button presses they will see the series of button presses again but with an additional step. If the user pressess the wrong button then the series starts again so that the user can retry. Each button has a corresponding sound that plays whenever either the user or the computer play the button.

Users can restart the game by hitting the start button. Users can turn on strict mode that makes the entire game restart whenever they get a button press wrong. There is also an input that keeps track of how many steps are in the current series of button presses. Finally, users win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. After users achieve this the game starts over.
